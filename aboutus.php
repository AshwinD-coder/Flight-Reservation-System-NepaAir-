        <h2><u><i>Introduction</i></h2></u>

    <article>
       <strong> NEPA Air</strong>, a household name in the Nepali aviation sector has became the trademark of trust and safety in 25 years of its service. Our journey had humbly begun on October 11, 1997, with a single aircraft. Today we fly to at least 10 national  destinations a day with our 15 state-of-art aircraft.

        Today, we conduct around 100 flights a day being the most trusted domestic airline in Nepal securing the trademark of trust and safety in 25 years of service. In these years of trusted flying, we have flown over 13.6 million passengers. Our market share is currently around 65 percent as we continue to make a profit for the past two decades.

        <b><u>The Initiators</u></b><br>
        Among the few aspirant entrepreneurs was Mr. Surendra Bahadur Basnet, the man who came from a humble background but had already made his influence through various senior positions in government jobs. Few of the reputed titles Mr. Basnet has been honored with are Chief Justice at the Supreme Court, Founder Chief Election Commissioner, Minister of Law, Justice, and Education, Minister of Finance Industry, Commerce & Supplies, First Chairman of Press Council, Legal Commissions.

        His elder son, Mr. Birendra Bahadur Basnet, who was always intrigued by entrepreneurship and business was involved in own his export company ‘Arju International’ at that time.

        Mr. Shivendra Bahadur Basnet, youngest son of Mr. Surendra Bahadur Basnet returned from Ukraine after completing his training as a helicopter pilot in 1994.

        The father-sons trio then realized the need and growing demand for air transport in the mountainous country to be a game-changer. And quickly enough they formally established Buddha Air for once and forever in 1997. Since then, the company is thriving every day under the supervision of Mr. Birendra Bahadur Basnet and the trusted team.

        <b><u>Our Journey</u></b><br>
        On 11 October 1997, Captain RK Sharma and American Pilot Captain Kevin St. Germain in an unprecedented flight, flew Buddha Air’s first batch of 16 passengers on flight BHA 100 onboard the Beech craft 1900 D. With the call sign 9N-AEE from Kathmandu’s domestic airport, flight BHA 100 took its hour-long flight to Mt Everest and back – an achievement no airlines had done in its maiden flight. This helped to set confidence in NEPA Air in motion and the rest is history.
